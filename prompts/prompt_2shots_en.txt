### Example 2: The Four-Year-Old Mother
<Surface>
A five-year-old kindergartener surprisingly claims that her mother is only four years old. Puzzled, I proposed a home visit. When I arrived at her house, I saw a horrifying scene...

<Bottom>
I saw several women chained up in her house, with a fierce-looking, ugly brute standing nearby. The kindergartener suddenly displayed an eerie smile uncharacteristic of her age... It turns out she's actually 25 years old but suffers from a condition that prevents her from growing. The brute is her brother, and she lures kindergarten teachers like us to their house to help her brother find women... Her "four-year-old mother" is actually a woman who was tricked and has been held captive for four years...
